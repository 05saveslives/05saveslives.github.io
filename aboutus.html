    <h1 class="title">About Us</h1>

    <div id="title-info">
        <p class="about-us-info">Our founders have backgrounds in transportation, public health, and global road safety.
            Our Honorary Chairman is Hon. Norman Y. Mineta,
            the longest serving Secretary of Transportation in U.S. history. Year after year,
            we have seen thousands of preventable deaths and injuries due to drinking and driving.
            Year after year, we have also seen the American public being misled about the strong evidence showing that
            our nation would save at least 1500 lives annually
            if every U.S. State passed a .05 BAC Law.</p>

        <p class="about-us-info">
            As a result, our founders formed the “05 Saves Lives” Coalition and created the
            accompanying website to provide easily accessible information and resources to help States, Territories,
            Municipalities, and others, pass .05 BAC Laws.
        </p>
        <p class="about-us-info">
            We know that a .05% BAC law is simply the right thing to do – it is backed by good science, the majority of
            Americans support it, and it has been proven around the world to save lives.
            This law does not necessarily increase arrests or decrease drinking. But it does deter impaired drivers
            before they get behind the wheel and it is most effective when combined
            with high visibility enforcement and education. A .05% BAC law separates drinking from driving – it is true,
            lifesaving, primary prevention.
        </p>
        <p class="about-us-info">

            We work towards the day when every US state and territory will have a .05% BAC Law - when we will no longer
            needlessly lose 1500 lives every year.
        </p>

        <p class="about-us-info">
            We know that you want to save lives. We encourage you to review the lifesaving evidence in support of .05
            BAC Law.</p>
